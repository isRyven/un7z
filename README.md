## un7z

A stand-alone library to extract `.7z` archives in memory.

* Small, about 20kb dependency.
* Distributed as an amalgamated source file and header.
* It supports only these compressors: `LZMA`, `LZMA2`, `BCJ`, `BCJ2`, `COPY`.
* It does not support (and may misbehave for) encryption in archives.
